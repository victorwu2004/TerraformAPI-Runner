The error indicates that the AWS provider in your Terraform configuration is missing valid credentials to authenticate with AWS. Terraform needs credentials to interact with the AWS API. Here’s how to resolve this issue:

### Steps to Fix the "No Credentials Provided" Error

1. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Terraform uses the same credentials as the AWS CLI or SDK. You can provide credentials in one of the following ways:

   #### Option 1: AWS Credentials File
   - Create or edit the AWS credentials file at `~/.aws/credentials` (Linux/Mac) or `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials` (Windows).
   - Add your AWS access key and secret key:
     ```ini
     [default]
     aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
     aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
     ```
   - You can generate these keys in the AWS Management Console under IAM > Users > Your User > Security credentials > Access keys.
   - Ensure the credentials file has proper permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 ~/.aws/credentials` on Linux/Mac).

   #### Option 2: Environment Variables
   - Set AWS credentials as environment variables. Run these commands in your terminal (replace with your actual keys):
     ```bash
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
     export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"  # Optional: Set your region
     ```
   - On Windows (Command Prompt):
     ```cmd
     set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
     set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
     set AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
     ```

   #### Option 3: AWS CLI Configuration
   - If you have the AWS CLI installed, configure credentials using:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```
   - Enter your access key, secret key, region, and output format when prompted. Terraform will automatically use these credentials.

   #### Option 4: IAM Role (EC2, ECS, or Lambda)
   - If running Terraform on an AWS resource (e.g., EC2 instance), attach an IAM role with the necessary permissions to the resource. Terraform will automatically use the role’s credentials.
   - Ensure the IAM role has policies allowing the actions required by your Terraform configuration (e.g., `s3:CreateBucket` for an S3 resource).

2. **Verify AWS Credentials**:
   - Test your credentials with the AWS CLI to confirm they work:
     ```bash
     aws sts get-caller-identity
     ```
   - This command should return your AWS account details. If it fails, double-check your credentials or IAM permissions.

3. **Update Terraform Configuration**:
   - Ensure your `provider "aws"` block in the `.tf` file specifies the correct region (if not set via environment variables):
     ```hcl
     provider "aws" {
       region = "us-east-1"  # Replace with your desired region
     }
     ```
   - If using a specific AWS profile, add:
     ```hcl
     provider "aws" {
       region  = "us-east-1"
       profile = "your-profile-name"  # Matches the profile in ~/.aws/credentials
     }
     ```

4. **Re-run Terraform**:
   - After setting up credentials, run:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     terraform plan
     terraform apply
     ```
   - If the error persists, use `terraform init -verbose` to get detailed output for troubleshooting.

5. **Common Issues to Check**:
   - **Invalid Credentials**: Ensure the access key and secret key are correct and not expired. Rotate keys in the AWS Console if needed.
   - **Permissions**: Verify the IAM user or role has the necessary permissions for the resources in your Terraform configuration.
   - **Region Mismatch**: Ensure the region in your `.tf` file or environment variable matches the region where your resources exist.
   - **Multiple Profiles**: If you have multiple AWS profiles, specify the correct one using the `profile` attribute or the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable:
     ```bash
     export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
     ```

6. **Best Practices**:
   - Avoid hardcoding credentials in `.tf` files (e.g., `access_key` and `secret_key` in the provider block) for security reasons.
   - Use IAM roles or temporary credentials (e.g., via AWS STS) for production environments.
   - Store sensitive data like secrets in a secure vault or use Terraform’s `sensitive` attribute for outputs.

### Example: Minimal Terraform Configuration
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name-123"
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If you still see the error, share the full error message or run:
  ```bash
  terraform plan -debug
  ```
- Check the AWS credentials file for typos or formatting issues.
- If using an IAM role, verify the role’s trust relationship and permissions policy.

If you need help with a specific AWS resource, IAM setup, or further debugging, let me know!
